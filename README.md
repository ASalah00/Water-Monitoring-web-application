Water quality monitoring:
This project regularly monitors and tracks the Turbidity value of the water and fitness of water for
drinking purposes and display the result (SAFE/UNSAFE) on an LCD screen and on the web application.

The pH value of water is periodically updated to the user over the internet. The user may set a “safe pH range” as
he desires using the web client. A buzzer sounds if the pH level goes out of specified
range.

Here is a video!
